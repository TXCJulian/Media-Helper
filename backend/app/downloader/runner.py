    accessor: an event that carries no path has no identity, and attributing
    it to the last-allocated row is wrong, because allocation only happens
    once a path is known - so while a *new* item is still resolving its
    destination, the last-allocated row still belongs to the *previous*,
    already-finished item. Writing to it there corrupts a completed sibling.
